<h1>Spotify Song Recommender</h1>
<p>For this project, I was put on a team with some fellow students. Our task was to build an app that takes in a song title from the user, then runs it through a model to find 10 similar songs based on attributes like mood and valence. For my contribution, I wrote the database, wrote a prototype cosine similarity model, performed EDA on the data, wrote the code for the app to interact with the Spotify API, and built the webapp itself. Regrettably, we were unable to get it deployed in time. This project is one I intend to come back to and refine.</p>
